## I – Introduction
In modern society, coffee has become one of the most popular daily consumer goods in the world and has integrated itself into modern culture. Coffee is omnipresent, appearing in various aspects of society, whether it be during conversations, in the workplace, and within households. A seemingly simple yet profoundly meaningful question often arises: "What constitutes a truly delicious cup of coffee?" There are myriad responses to this query, ranging from the type of coffee, its brand, origin, and even its price. Addressing all these factors comprehensively is a daunting task, but my research will focus on one aspect that cannot be overlooked: the impact of climate in countries where coffee is grown. That leads to the name of this project, Climate's brew.
## II – Dataset
For my research, I will mainly use data I found online. Most of these datasets are from Kaggle, a website for learning about data science. The datasets that I will use include:
-	Daily Temperature of Major Cities: This dataset will provide me with information about temperature conditions in major cities around the world over time, allowing me to filter out areas where coffee is grown.
-	Coffee Dataset: This dataset gives me coffee economic indicators, from which I can find the major coffee producing and exporting countries in the world.
-	Coffee Review: This dataset provides me with additional information regarding the taste and price of coffee, enabling me to assess the overall output quality of the coffee production process.
Also, as I go through my research, I might find other documents and datasets that could help me analyze and draw conclusions.
## III - Objectives
	The goal of this analysis is to explore the correlation between temperature changes in coffee-producing countries, explaining the influence of climatic conditions on coffee output and quality in various nations, particularly those with substantial coffee exports. In addition to understanding the impact of climate, this research also delves into coffee processing methods and their effects on the price and taste of coffee. This research aims to address the following questions:
-	Which countries export and consume the most coffee?
-	How environmental conditions of a country with large coffee production?
-	How to determine the flavor of coffee? What kind of coffee beans are considered delicious?
-	What are other elements of a good cup of coffee need?
From the objectives outlined in this research paper, I aim to provide valuable insights into the impacts throughout the coffee bean's journey. As an avid coffee enthusiast, I hope this research will contribute to enhancing the enjoyment of our morning cups of coffee.
